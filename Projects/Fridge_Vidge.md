Fridge Vidge

Summary: use machine vision to accurately catalogue what's in my fridge!

v1:
	LOW HANGING FRUIT bar codes
		Single image of inside, bar codes facing out
		image of door items

vFutures:
	- moving video of internals of fridge
		only need to identify a barcode once
		SLAM to prevent duplicate items?
	- non-barcoded items: fruits, veggies, etc
	- expiration dates
	- highlighting clustered/layered areas
	- time state: expiration dates, item counts (how many eggs, how much milk[prolly not possible], % cheese eaten)
	- 3d mapping of items?
	- consumption efficiency: items gone bad, category typically uneaten, macro contents, diet cokes/week/day
	- cooking efficiency: recipes, ripeness
	- grocery sales: restocking
