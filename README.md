Mission Statement: Create a high resolution facial puppetry of a target person based off a source actors facial expression, head pose, and mouth movements.

This is a repo for all my Machine Learning Notes, from notetaking to reading lists and ML glossaries.

Trying to understand the algorithms out there with an emphasis on execution. Ultimately trying to do face puppetry, taking a source actors face and pose
